## The first one: Streamlining ssh Configuration
First I will show how I edit my `.ssh/config` file. Here is the screenshot of my code:![ssh](ssh-config.PNG)
I create a new file like this and put these codes into this file, this directly tells `ssh` to log into my account.
Then the ssh command logging into my account using just the alias I chose:
![ssh](ssh.PNG)
Then we can also directly using scp with the alias I chose:
![scp](scp.PNG)
This case we copy test-file.md from my computer to the account.
